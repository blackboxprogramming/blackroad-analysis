### Cover Letter Template
```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

I'm the rare professional with FINRA licenses (Series 7/63/65) who builds 
production AI infrastructure at scale. In under 2 years, I:

• Built 1,094 repositories across 15 GitHub organizations
• Deployed 30,000-agent distributed AI platform (74+ days uptime)
• Generated $23M+ in enterprise sales with 97% client satisfaction

Most AI engineers don't understand financial compliance.
Most financial professionals don't build distributed systems.
I do both.
