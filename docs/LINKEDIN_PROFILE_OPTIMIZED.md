## ABOUT SECTION (2,600 characters max)

🚀 **AI Orchestration Engineer building enterprise systems at the intersection of financial services and cutting-edge technology.**

I'm the rare professional who holds FINRA licenses (Series 7/63/65) AND builds production AI infrastructure at scale. In under 2 years, I've:

**TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:**
• Built BlackRoad OS: 1,094 repositories across 15 GitHub organizations  
• Deployed 30,000-agent distributed AI platform with hardware acceleration  
• Created 7-node hybrid edge-cloud cluster (74+ days production uptime)  
• Implemented 26-industry compliance framework (FINRA, SEC, HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, CCPA)  
• Developed custom workflow orchestration engine integrating Temporal, Prefect, n8n, Huginn, Airflow  

**BUSINESS RESULTS:**
• $23M+ in annuity sales at Securian Financial (92% of goal)  
• $18.4M in AUM opportunities identified at Ameriprise Financial  
• #1 national ranking for qualified appointment setting  
• 97% client satisfaction rating  
• 33% efficiency improvement through Salesforce automation (measured)  

**WHAT MAKES ME UNIQUE:**

Most AI engineers don't understand financial services compliance.  
Most financial professionals don't build distributed systems.  
I do both.

I built BlackRoad OS using AI as my engineering team—proving that human-AI collaboration isn't theoretical, it's the competitive advantage today. This approach enabled 50%+ reduction in development cycle times while maintaining enterprise-grade security and regulatory compliance.

**MY EXPERTISE:**
✅ Multi-agent orchestration (30,000-agent capacity)  
✅ Workflow automation (Temporal, Prefect, n8n, Huginn, Airflow)  
✅ Financial services compliance (FINRA, SEC, HIPAA, SOX)  
✅ Distributed systems (hybrid edge-cloud architecture)  
✅ Zero Trust security & cryptographic audit trails  
✅ Enterprise sales ($41M+ combined track record)  

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:**

Roles where my unique combination of skills creates exceptional value:
• AI Orchestration / Multi-Agent Systems Engineering  
• FinTech / Financial Services Technology  
• AI Automation / Intelligent Process Automation  
• CTO / VP Engineering / Head of AI (leadership)  
• Financial Planning / Paraplanning (with tech innovation focus)  

**PHILOSOPHY:**

"Not about 100% certainty—about love, community, wonder, and freedom to choose YOUR path."

I build AI systems that empower rather than replace humans. Compliance isn't an obstacle—it's a feature that creates competitive advantage.
