## Partner Program Philosophy

**"We grow when our partners grow."**

BlackRoad OS is designed for **partner-led growth**. The platform's complexity (agent orchestration, compliance, cryptography) creates natural demand for implementation partners, system integrators, and consultants.

**Our commitment:**
- **Fair revenue sharing** (20-30% margins for partners)
- **Co-marketing support** (joint case studies, webinars, events)
- **Technical enablement** (certification, training, engineering support)
- **Deal registration protection** (first partner to register gets the commission)

## Revenue Sharing Models

### Model 1: Reseller (Transactional)

**How it works:**
1. Partner sells BlackRoad OS license to end customer
2. Partner invoices customer (collects payment)
3. Partner remits 80% to BlackRoad OS monthly
4. Partner keeps 20% as margin

**Example:**
- Customer pays partner: $5,000/month (Enterprise tier)
- Partner remits to BlackRoad OS: $4,000/month
- Partner keeps: $1,000/month (20% margin)

**Payment terms:** Net 30 from partner to BlackRoad OS

---

### Model 2: Agency/Referral

**How it works:**
1. Partner refers customer to BlackRoad OS
2. BlackRoad OS sells directly (handles contract, billing)
3. BlackRoad OS pays partner commission monthly

**Example:**
- Customer pays BlackRoad OS: $5,000/month
- BlackRoad OS pays partner: $500/month (10% referral fee)

**Payment terms:** Net 30 from BlackRoad OS to partner

---

### Model 3: Implementation Services

**How it works:**
1. Customer buys BlackRoad OS license from BlackRoad OS
2. Customer hires partner for implementation services
3. Partner bills customer directly for services
4. BlackRoad OS pays partner 10% recurring revenue share (on top of services revenue)

**Example:**
- Customer pays BlackRoad OS: $60K/year (Enterprise license)
- Customer pays partner: $50K (one-time implementation fee)
- BlackRoad OS pays partner: $500/month ongoing (10% of $5K/month license)

**Total partner revenue:**
- Year 1: $50K (services) + $6K (recurring) = $56K
- Year 2+: $6K/year recurring

---

### Model 4: OEM/White-Label

**How it works:**
1. Technology partner embeds BlackRoad OS into their product
2. Partner bills end customer (BlackRoad OS is invisible to customer)
3. Partner pays BlackRoad OS per-seat or per-usage fee

**Example:**
- Partner charges customer: $10K/month (their product + BlackRoad OS embedded)
- Partner pays BlackRoad OS: $2K/month (20% of their revenue attributable to agent orchestration)

**Payment terms:** Custom contract (typically quarterly minimum commitments)

## Deal Registration & Protection
