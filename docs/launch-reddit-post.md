# I built 3 SaaS alternatives to expensive tools - all live today

**TL;DR:** Analyzed 340+ open source projects, built better alternatives. RoadWork ($9 vs Chegg $20), PitStop ($29 DevOps), Canvas Studio (FREE vs Canva $13).

## The Problem

I'm tired of paying $20/month for basic tools. Chegg, Canva, Adobe, Notion... it adds up to $200+/month just to do homework, design graphics, or manage infrastructure.

So I built better alternatives at honest prices.
