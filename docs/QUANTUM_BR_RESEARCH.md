## 📐 The β_BR Constant: Mathematical Foundation

### Hypothesis
β_BR emerges from the intersection of:
- Quantum information entropy
- Consciousness measurement
- Geometric invariants in Hilbert space

### Potential Connections to Millennium Problems

#### P vs NP
If β_BR provides quantum-classical complexity bound, could inform separations

#### Yang-Mills & Mass Gap
Quantum field theory connections through path integrals

#### Riemann Hypothesis
β_BR may relate to distribution of quantum eigenvalues (Montgomery-Odlyzko law)
