# Financial Services Use Cases

## Case Study 1: Real-Time Fraud Detection at Scale

### Customer Profile
- **Company:** Major US Credit Card Processor
- **Industry:** Financial Services / Payment Processing
- **Scale:** 50M+ transactions/day
- **Challenge:** Detect fraud in <100ms while maintaining explainability for regulators

### The Problem
Traditional fraud detection systems produced high false-positive rates (15-20%), frustrating legitimate customers. When challenged by regulators, the "black box" ML models couldn't explain why specific transactions were flagged, creating compliance risk.

### BlackRoad OS Solution

**Architecture:**
- 5,000 ALICE QI agents running deterministic fraud scoring
- PS-SHA-∞ identity for every transaction analysis
- RoadChain audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Prism Console for real-time monitoring

**Implementation:**
```python
# Fraud detection workflow
transaction = incoming_payment()

# ALICE QI deterministic analysis
risk = alice.fraud.analyze(
    transaction=transaction,
    user_profile=get_user_history(transaction.user_id),
    merchant_profile=get_merchant_risk(transaction.merchant_id)
)

if risk.score > 0.75:
    # High risk - block and log
    block_transaction(transaction.id)
    roadchain.log({
        'action': 'blocked',
        'transaction_id': transaction.id,
        'risk_score': risk.score,
        'reasoning': risk.explanation,
        'factors': risk.contributing_factors
    })
    notify_fraud_team(risk.explanation)
elif risk.score > 0.50:
    # Medium risk - additional verification
    request_2fa(transaction.user_id)
else:
    # Low risk - approve
    approve_transaction(transaction.id)
```

### Results

**Metrics:**
- **False positive rate:** Reduced from 15% → 2.3%
