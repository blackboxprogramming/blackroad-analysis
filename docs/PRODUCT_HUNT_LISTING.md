## 📝 Full Description

### What is BlackRoad OS?

BlackRoad OS is an AI-first operating system for modern teams. We've taken everything you need to ship products—deployment, collaboration, workflow automation, analytics—and unified it into one platform.

### The Problem

Your team probably uses:
- Slack (communication)
- GitHub (code)
- Linear (tasks)
- Notion (docs)
- Vercel/Railway (deployment)
- Stripe (payments)
- Clerk (auth)
- Sentry (monitoring)
- PostHog (analytics)

That's $500+/month, 10 browser tabs, and constant context switching.

### The Solution

BlackRoad OS gives you:

**⚡ Instant Deployments**
Deploy to production in seconds, not hours. Built on Cloudflare Pages and Railway for global edge performance.

**🤖 AI-Powered Workflows**
Automate everything from code reviews to customer support with built-in AI agents.

**🔒 Enterprise Security**
SSO, SAML, SOC 2 compliance, and custom security policies out of the box.

**📊 Real-Time Analytics**
Know exactly what's happening in your product, your team, and your infrastructure.

**🎨 Beautiful UI**
Because developer tools shouldn't look like they're from 2010.

### Who is it for?

- **Startups** shipping MVP to market
- **Dev teams** tired of tool sprawl
- **Solo builders** who need enterprise features
- **Agencies** managing multiple clients

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS 4
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- AI: Claude/GPT-4 integration
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages, Railway
- Payments: Stripe
- Auth: Clerk

### Launch Special

**🎁 First 100 founding members get 50% off FOREVER**

That means $29/month instead of $58. For life. No gimmicks.

Why? Because early adopters take a risk on us. We reward that.

### How We Built This

We shipped BlackRoad OS from idea to revenue in ONE SESSION using Claude AI. No weeks of planning. No months of development. Just pure execution.

This is the future of AI-native development.

### What's Next?

We're adding:
- GitHub integration (auto-deploy on push)
- Linear integration (sync issues)
- Custom AI agents (build your own workflows)
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)

## 💬 First Comment (Post This Immediately After Launch)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Alexa, founder of BlackRoad OS.

**The Story:**

I got tired of paying $500/month for 10 different SaaS tools just to ship a product. Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Vercel, Railway, Stripe, Clerk, Sentry, PostHog... the list goes on.

So I built BlackRoad OS: Everything you need to ship products, in one platform, for $29/month.

**What makes this different:**

1. **We shipped it in ONE SESSION** using Claude AI. From idea to live payment links. This is what AI-native development looks like in 2025.

2. **We're rewarding early adopters** with 50% off for LIFE. Not a promo code that expires. Not "first year only." Forever.

3. **We're building in public.** Every feature, every decision, every line of code—it's all transparent.

**What we're looking for:**

- **Feedback:** What features do you need most?
- **Beta users:** Try it free for 14 days, tell us what breaks
- **Founding members:** 79 spots left at $29/mo (50% off forever)

**Special PH offer:**

Use code **PRODUCTHUNT** at checkout for an extra month free on top of the 14-day trial.

Let's make developer tools fun again! 🚀

Ask me anything!
