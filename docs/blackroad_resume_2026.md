## 📝 NOTES FOR INTERVIEWS

**What makes this unique:**
- Not just using existing frameworks - built custom orchestration
- Hybrid edge-cloud (not just cloud, not just local)
- Self-hosted VPN mesh (not relying on cloud services)
- Hardware AI acceleration (not just GPU in cloud)
- Production at scale (not just demo/POC)

**Challenges solved:**
- Dynamic IP addresses with DHCP (solved with Tailscale)
- Distributed state management across heterogeneous nodes
- Capacity planning for 30k agents across limited hardware
- Failover and disaster recovery for edge devices
- Disk space management on embedded systems

**Ready to discuss:**
- Why custom orchestration vs existing tools
- How agent communication works at scale
- Capacity planning and resource allocation strategies
- Edge-cloud hybrid architecture trade-offs
- Self-hosting vs managed services decisions
