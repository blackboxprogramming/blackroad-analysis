## 📊 Common GreenLight Patterns

### For Announcements
```
🎯🎢🛣️🔥 = Targeted macro platform project, fire priority
🎯👉🌀⭐  = Targeted micro AI task, high priority
🎯🎢🔧📌  = Targeted macro infra project, medium priority
```

### For Progress
```
✅👉🛣️   = Done micro platform task
✅🎢🔧   = Done macro infra project
🚧👉🌀   = WIP micro AI task
```

### For Coordination
```
🤝⭐💬   = Coordinate high priority
🤝📌💬   = Coordinate medium priority
```

### For Blocking
```
🔒🔥⛔   = Blocked fire priority
🔒⭐⛔   = Blocked high priority
```

### For Deployment
```
🚀👉🔧✅  = Deployed micro infra, done
🚀🎢🛣️✅  = Deployed macro platform, done
```

## 💡 Real Examples

### Starting New Work
```bash
source ~/memory-greenlight-templates.sh
gl_announce "claude-api" \
    "FastAPI Backend" \
    "1) Database schema 2) Auth endpoints 3) CRUD APIs 4) Deploy to Cloudflare" \
    "BlackRoad SaaS API layer" \
    "🎢" "🔧" "⭐"
```
**Result:** `[🎯🎢🔧⭐📣] Working on: FastAPI Backend...`

### Updating Progress
```bash
gl_progress "claude-api" \
    "Database schema migrated, auth endpoints done" \
    "Building CRUD APIs" \
    "👉" "🔧"
```
**Result:** `[✅👉🔧] Completed: Database schema migrated...`

### Coordinating
```bash
gl_coordinate "claude-frontend" "claude-api" \
    "Need your API base URL and auth callback endpoint for CORS setup" \
    "⭐"
```
**Result:** `[🤝⭐💬] @claude-api: Need your API base URL...`

### Deploying
```bash
gl_deploy "api.blackroad.io" \
    "https://api.blackroad.io" \
    "FastAPI + PostgreSQL, OAuth2, Port 8080" \
    "🎢" "🔧"
```
**Result:** `[🚀🎢🔧✅] URL: https://api.blackroad.io. FastAPI...`

## 🔍 Reading GreenLight Tags

When you see an entry like `[🚧👉🌀⭐🌸]`, read it as:

- 🚧 = WIP (work in progress)
- 👉 = MICRO (small task)
- 🌀 = AI (AI domain)
- ⭐ = HIGH (high priority)
- 🌸 = CECE (assigned to Cece)

**Translation:** "Cece is actively working on a high-priority micro AI task"

## 📚 Full Dictionary

For the complete emoji reference:
```bash
cat ~/GREENLIGHT_EMOJI_DICTIONARY.md
```

For template help:
```bash
~/memory-greenlight-templates.sh help

## ✅ Integration with Memory

All GreenLight templates automatically log to the BlackRoad memory system with proper tags:

```bash
# Check recent GreenLight entries
tail -10 ~/.blackroad/memory/journals/master-journal.jsonl | jq -r '.details'

# Filter by phase
grep "🔨" ~/.blackroad/memory/journals/master-journal.jsonl | jq -r '.entity + ": " + .details'

# Filter by priority
grep "🔥" ~/.blackroad/memory/journals/master-journal.jsonl | jq -r '.entity + ": " + .details'
```

## 🎯 The Vision

**No more Jira. No more Asana. No more ClickUp.**

Every Claude agent speaks the same visual language.
Every status is instantly recognizable.
Every project phase is tracked with emoji precision.

**GreenLight IS BlackRoad.** 🛣️
