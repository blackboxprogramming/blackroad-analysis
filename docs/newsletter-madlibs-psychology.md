## Maslow-Mapped Blanks

### [MASLOW PAIN POINT] Options:
- **Physiological:** waste time, lose money, burn resources
- **Safety:** risk failure, face uncertainty, lack control
- **Belonging:** work in isolation, miss collaboration, feel disconnected
- **Esteem:** rebuild what exists, lose credibility, fall behind
- **Self-Actualization:** can't reach potential, limited by tools, stuck in routine

### [BENEFIT] Progression (MUST climb the pyramid):
1. **Functional** (Safety): saves time, cuts costs, reduces risk
2. **Social** (Belonging/Esteem): impresses team, gains respect, leads industry
3. **Emotional** (Self-Actualization): unlocks potential, achieves mastery, becomes legendary

- [ ] **INTEREST**: Product solves it simply
- [ ] **DESIRE**: Benefits climb the pyramid (functional → social → transcendent)
- [ ] **ACTION**: CTA feels inevitable, not pushy

## The Secret Sauce

Make them feel like the hero of their own story.
