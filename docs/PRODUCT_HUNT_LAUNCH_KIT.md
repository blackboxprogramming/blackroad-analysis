## 💬 First Comment Template

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Alexa, founder of BlackRoad OS. After years of building AI systems, I got frustrated with the fragmented tooling landscape. So I built BlackRoad OS.

## What is it?

BlackRoad OS is a complete operating system for AI infrastructure. Think of it as "Kubernetes for AI agents" - but much easier to use.

## Why did I build this?

Three problems kept coming up:

1. **Tool Sprawl** - Teams use 20+ different tools
2. **Agent Chaos** - No way to manage 100+ AI agents
3. **Vendor Lock-in** - Trapped in proprietary platforms

BlackRoad OS solves all three.

## What's included?

✨ **60 Enterprise Products**
- Prism Console (monitoring)
- Lucidia AI (agent orchestration)
- Multi-AI System (1000+ agent scale)
- And 57 more...

🚀 **Key Features**
- Deploy in 5 minutes
- Self-hosted or cloud
- Open-core model
- Production-ready

💰 **Pricing**
- Developer: Free forever
- Professional: $499/month
- Enterprise: Custom

## Who is it for?

- **DevOps Teams** - Simplify infrastructure
- **AI Engineers** - Scale to 1000s of agents
- **Enterprises** - Full control + compliance

## Special Launch Offer

First 100 customers get **50% off for life**. Just use code **PRODUCTHUNT50** at checkout.
