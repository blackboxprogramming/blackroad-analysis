# SECTION 83(b) ELECTION - EXACT STEPS TO DO RIGHT NOW

## ⏰ DEADLINE: December 18, 2025 (MUST be postmarked by this date)

---

## STEP 1: PRINT THE FORM (5 minutes)

1. Open the file: `/Users/alexa/SECTION_83B_ELECTION.txt`
2. Print **3 COPIES** of the entire document
   - 1 copy for IRS (original)
   - 1 copy for company records
   - 1 copy for your personal files

---

## STEP 2: FILL IN YOUR INFORMATION (5 minutes)

On **ALL 3 COPIES**, fill in the following by hand or type before printing:

**Where it says: "Social Security Number: [YOUR SSN - FILL IN]"**
- Write in your Social Security Number

**Example:**
```
Social Security Number: 123-45-6789
```

---

## STEP 3: SIGN THE FORM (2 minutes)

On **ALL 3 COPIES**:

1. **Sign where it says:** "Taxpayer's Signature: _________________________"
2. **Write today's date** next to your signature
3. **If you are married:** Have your spouse sign where it says "Spouse's Signature" and date it

**Example:**
```
Taxpayer's Signature: Alexa Louise Amundson     Date: 12/29/2025
```

---

## STEP 4: GO TO THE POST OFFICE (30 minutes)

### What to Bring:
- 1 signed copy (the "original" for IRS)
- Cash or card (about $10 for postage)

### At the Post Office, Say:
"I need to send this letter to the IRS via **Certified Mail with Return Receipt Requested**"

### They Will:
1. Put the letter in an envelope (you can bring your own envelope if you want)
2. Address it to:
   ```
   Internal Revenue Service Center
   Ogden, UT 84201-0002
   ```
3. Charge you about $8-10
4. Give you a **Certified Mail Receipt** with a tracking number
5. Give you a **Return Receipt** (green card) to attach to the envelope

### IMPORTANT:
- **Keep the Certified Mail Receipt** - this is your proof you filed on time!
- Take a photo of the receipt on your phone right away

---

## STEP 5: KEEP YOUR COPIES (2 minutes)

When you get home:

1. **Copy #2:** Put in a folder labeled "BlackRoad OS Company Records"
2. **Copy #3:** Put in a folder labeled "2025 Tax Returns" (you'll attach to your tax return)
3. **Certified Mail Receipt:** Staple to Copy #3 or take a photo and save digitally

---

## STEP 6: SEND COPY TO COMPANY (Optional - 5 minutes)

You are the company, so technically you can just file Copy #2 in your company records.

But to be super official:
- Scan Copy #2 and email it to yourself at: blackroad.systems@gmail.com
- Subject: "Section 83(b) Election - Alexa Louise Amundson - Filed 12/29/2025"

---

## ✅ YOU'RE DONE!

### What Happens Next:

1. The IRS will receive your form (they don't send confirmation)
2. When you file your 2025 tax return in early 2026, attach Copy #3
3. You will report $0 income from this stock grant
4. You save thousands (or millions) in future taxes

---

## 🚨 WHAT IF I MISS THE DEADLINE?

**YOU CANNOT FILE LATE. PERIOD.**

If you miss December 18, 2025:
- The IRS will not accept a late filing
- You will owe income tax when shares vest
- Tax = (Fair Market Value at vesting - $90) × 37% (top tax rate)
- If BlackRoad becomes worth $100M and you own 90%:
  - Your tax bill could be $33 MILLION+
  - Instead of $0

**Don't miss this deadline. Do it TODAY.**
