  Case Study: The 11:47 AM Call

  When Every Minute Matters

  ---
  The Situation

  Client: Margaret Chen, 67, retired teacher
  Account Value: $1.2M across IRA, joint brokerage, annuity
  Relationship: 12 years with advisor David Rodriguez

  What Happened:

  Margaret's husband Richard, 71, suffered a fatal heart attack Tuesday morning. He was the primary account holder on their
  joint brokerage. Margaret is at the hospital. Richard's body is still in the ICU. The hospital billing office has already
  approached her about a $47,000 balance from his 3-week stay. Her sister is flying in tomorrow. She needs $50,000 in her
  checking account by Friday to cover the hospital, funeral home deposit, and keep the lights on.

  She calls David at 11:47 AM, barely able to speak through tears.

  CURRENT STATE: The Advisor's Next 4 Hours

  11:47 AM — The Call

  David answers. Margaret is hyperventilating. He spends 8 minutes calming her down, getting basic facts. She says "I just
  need money, David. I don't know what to do."

  11:55 AM — Searching for Information

     a) Opens Salesforce FSC to pull up the Chen household
        - Finds Margaret's contact info, but Richard is listed as primary
        - Notes from last annual review mention "Richard handles finances"
        - No record of Margaret's individual access permissions

     b) Opens Thomson ONE in separate browser tab
        - Joint brokerage shows $340K, but titled "Richard Chen JTWROS"
        - Need to verify Margaret's survivorship rights
        - Trading restricted until death certificate processed

     c) Opens eMoney Advisor in third tab
        - Cash flow plan shows they have $8K monthly expenses
        - Emergency fund was in Richard's individual checking (not visible)
        - Margaret's IRA shows $680K but 10% penalty if under 59½—wait, she's 67, ok

     d) Opens Total View to see external accounts
        - Last aggregation was 6 days ago
        - Richard's Fidelity 401(k) showing $190K—but that's in his name only
        - Margaret's pension direct deposits to a credit union account David doesn't have details on

  12:15 PM — Compliance Questions

     a) David realizes he needs to verify Margaret's authority to act
        - Searches Salesforce files for POA documents—finds nothing
        - Searches PracticeTech document vault—finds 2019 account application, no POA
        - Calls compliance: "Can Margaret request distribution from joint account before death certificate?"
        - Compliance says "check the account agreement"—where is that?

     b) Opens PracticeTech to search for original account documents
        - System is slow, searching...
        - Finds account agreement from 2014 migration—it's a scanned PDF, not searchable
        - Manually scrolls through 47 pages looking for survivorship language

  12:40 PM — Finding the Money

     a) Best option: Margaret's IRA—she's the owner, no estate issues
        - Opens eMoney to model the distribution: $50K from IRA
        - Tax withholding: federal 10%, state 5%—she'll only net $42,500
        - Needs to request $59,000 gross to get $50K net

     b) Opens Thomson ONE to check IRA holdings
        - $680K but $210K is in an annuity with 7-year surrender (bought 2021)
        - Remaining $470K is in managed account—need to liquidate positions
        - Which positions? Need to check cost basis for tax efficiency
        - Thomson ONE shows cost basis but not in a format eMoney can use

     c) Manually exports Thomson ONE positions to Excel
        - Calculates which lots to sell to minimize capital gains
        - Wait—it's an IRA, no capital gains. Wasted 15 minutes.

  1:10 PM — Starting the Distribution

     a) Opens PracticeTech to initiate IRA distribution
        - Form requires: distribution amount, withholding election, delivery method
        - Delivery method: check or ACH?
        - Margaret's bank account on file is joint with Richard—will bank accept deposit?
        - Calls Margaret: "Is your checking account joint or individual?"
        - She doesn't know. Richard handled it. She's crying again.

     b) David calls the bank (on Margaret's behalf with verbal authorization)
        - 20 minutes on hold
        - Bank confirms account is joint, will accept deposits, but may freeze pending estate review
        - Recommends Margaret open individual account—but that takes 2-3 business days

     c) Decision: ACH to joint checking, hope it clears before bank freezes

  1:45 PM — Processing the Request

     a) Completes PracticeTech distribution form
        - $59,000 gross, 15% combined withholding
        - ACH to checking account ending 4471
        - Uploads copy of Margaret's driver's license (she texted a photo)
        - Submits to compliance queue

     b) Compliance questions come back at 2:30 PM via email:
        - "Please confirm client's current address matches ID"
        - "Please provide verbal authorization documentation"
        - David didn't record the call. Has to call Margaret again.

     c) Calls Margaret at 2:45 PM
        - She's now at the funeral home, picking a casket
        - "David, I already told you I need the money"
        - He explains compliance requirements, asks her to verbally confirm
        - She's frustrated, embarrassed, grieving

     a) Documents verbal authorization in Salesforce FSC
     b) Resubmits to compliance queue
     c) Compliance approves at 4:10 PM

     b) Silence on the line. Then: "The funeral home needs $15,000 by tomorrow or they won't hold the date."
     c) David: "Do you have a credit card?"
     d) Margaret: "Richard had the credit cards."

  4:00 PM — Scrambling

     a) David calls his manager about expedited processing
     b) Manager says "overnight check is possible but $30 fee and requires branch signature"
     c) Nearest branch is 45 minutes from Margaret
     d) Margaret's sister won't arrive until tomorrow night
     e) David offers to drive the check to Margaret himself—against policy, but what else can he do?

  5:30 PM — Resolution (Sort Of)

     a) Compliance approves overnight check
     b) Check will arrive Saturday (not Friday)
     c) David calls funeral home, personally guarantees payment, gives his own credit card for the $15,000 deposit
     d) Will reconcile with Margaret's funds Monday
     e) Documents everything in Salesforce, praying this doesn't become a compliance issue

  6:45 PM — David Goes Home

     a) Emotionally exhausted
     b) Spent 7 hours on one client crisis
     c) Missed 3 other client calls, 2 prospect meetings
     d) Still doesn't know if the joint checking will freeze

  The Technical Reality

  This isn't about replacing Ameriprise's stack. It's about connecting it:

  | System         | Already Does                | Integration Adds                                                  |
  |----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

  | Thomson ONE    | Account activity, positions | Real-time alerts piped to dashboard, cash availability calculated |
  | eMoney Advisor | Financial planning          | Distribution tax modeling embedded in workflow                    |
  | Total View     | Account aggregation         | Daily refresh, anomaly detection (no login = flag)                |
  | PracticeTech   | Forms, e-signature          | Pre-populated forms, compliance rules engine                      |
  | MicroStrategy  | Practice analytics          | Client-level audit trail, not just practice metrics               |

  The integration layer doesn't replace these tools. It makes them talk to each other.
