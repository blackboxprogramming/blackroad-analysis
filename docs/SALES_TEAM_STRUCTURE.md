# BlackRoad OS: Sales Team Structure & Compensation Plan

*Building a high-velocity, product-led sales organization optimized for open-source GTM*

---

## 🎯 Sales Philosophy

### **Product-Led Growth (PLG) First, Sales-Assisted Second**

BlackRoad's sales motion is fundamentally different from traditional enterprise software:

1. **Free Tier → Viral Adoption** (80% of users never talk to sales)
2. **Self-Service Upgrade** (15% upgrade via credit card, no human touch)
3. **Sales-Assisted Expansion** (5% need help, but they're already convinced)

**This means**: Sales team is **enablement and expansion**, NOT cold outreach and persuasion.

## 🧠 Sales Leadership Principles

- 80% of revenue should come from PLG motion (free → paid upgrade)
- Sales assists, not initiates
- Focus on expansion, not net-new cold outreach

### **2. Technical Credibility**
- Every AE must be able to demo the product
- SEs are equal partners, not "demo monkeys"
- Sales team contributes to product roadmap based on customer feedback

### **3. Customer Success = Sales Success**
- No commission paid until customer is live in production
- NPS score impacts variable comp
- Upsell/expansion is easier than new logo hunting

### **4. Transparency & Coaching**
- All calls recorded (Gong)
- Weekly 1:1s with every rep
- Public dashboards (pipeline, attainment, leaderboard)
- No sandbags, no surprises

### **5. Diversity & Inclusion**
- Hire for potential, not pedigree
- 50% of sales team should be underrepresented groups by 2027
- Equal pay for equal performance
