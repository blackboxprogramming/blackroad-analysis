### Feature Threads

**Thread 1: Agent Scale**
```
Why BlackRoad OS can handle 1000+ AI agents (and others can't) 🧵

1/ Most systems break at 50 agents
We handle 1000+ in production

2/ The secret? Distributed architecture
Each agent is independent, scales horizontally

3/ Real-world example:
Company went from 10 → 500 agents in 30 days
Zero downtime, zero issues

4/ Plus intelligent load balancing
Agents auto-distribute across your cluster

5/ Want to try it?
Start with 10 free agents: https://blackroad.io

**Thread 2: Cost Comparison**
```

Would love to share our journey on your podcast:

• Built 60 enterprise products in 2 years
• 1,225 GitHub repositories
• $43M+ revenue potential

The interesting angle: We're building in the open. Everything on GitHub. No VC funding. Just customers.

I can talk about:
- Building AI products that scale
- Bootstrapping to $10M ARR
