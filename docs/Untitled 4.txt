• Using skill-creator because this is a new reusable “memory bootstrap”
  capability that needs a skill definition.

  To design it properly, I need a few specifics:

  - What exactly should the [MEMORY] script do at session start (inputs,
    outputs, side effects)? Example command(s) and expected results would help.
  - Where should it live and how should Codex invoke it (repo scripts/,
    $CODEX_HOME/skills, shell alias, or a standard “run this at start”
    instruction in AGENTS.md)?
  - Should it run for every session globally, or only in certain repos?

  If you want, I can scan for existing memory-*.sh scripts in this workspace and
  adapt one—just say the word.
