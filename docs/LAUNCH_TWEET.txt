I built a Railway alternative.

- $20/month flat (vs Railway's $5 + $10/GB)
- Self-hosted (your infrastructure, your rules)
- Unlimited apps
- Zero vendor lock-in

Deploy anything: Node, Python, Go, Rust, Docker.
Push to GitHub → Auto-deploy.

Try it: deploy.blackroad.io

Open source. Own your stack.
