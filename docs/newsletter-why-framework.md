## The Psychology Behind Each Why

### WHY NOW
- Creates urgency (window closing, new tech available, others moving)
- FOMO trigger: "just became possible/available/real"
- Timing: "won't last, moving fast, already happening"

### WHY CHANGE
- Shows current pain (what breaks, costs, hurts)
- Quantifies loss (time, money, credibility, opportunity)
- Makes status quo unbearable

### WHY CARE
- Emotional transformation ("feels like...")
- Self-actualization payoff (legendary, superpowers, who you become)
- Identity shift, not feature benefit

## Writing Rules
1. **STAT must hurt** - loss, waste, or missed opportunity
2. **WHY NOW uses "just"** - "just became, just started, just made"
3. **WHY CHANGE shows cost** - time, money, credibility, dreams
4. **WHY CARE uses "feels like"** - emotional state, not feature
5. **CTA = 1 word** - the action is inevitable by now
