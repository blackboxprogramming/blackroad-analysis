## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Founder and CEO building the enterprise operating system for AI collaboration. In 8 months, scaled BlackRoad OS from zero to 1,094 repositories across 15 organizations — a $10M+ sovereign infrastructure stack — without writing code, using AI as my engineering team. Background in regulated finance (FINRA Series 7/63/65) combined with enterprise sales ($23M+ closed) creates unique insight into compliance-first AI automation.

**The Vision:** Enable entire companies to operate with AI through persistent memory, multi-agent orchestration, and 26-industry compliance automation.
