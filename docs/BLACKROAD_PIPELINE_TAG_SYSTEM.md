# BlackRoad OS - Pipeline Tag System & Lead Scoring

**Intelligent lead tracking with engagement signals and auto-drips**
**Generated by:** Copernicus (copywriting specialist)
**Date:** January 4, 2026

## Core Philosophy

**The best sales systems are self-healing:**
- Automatically identify hot leads (action-click signals)
- Auto-nurture dormant leads (re-engagement drips)
- Alert reps to buying signals in real-time (commit-clicks)
- Make every lead feel like the only lead (personalized triggers)

---

## Engagement Signals (Auto-Tagged)

### Signal Detection Logic

```
SIGNAL                    TAG                    MEANING                          ACTION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Opened email 1x           📬 opened              Aware, curious                   Wait 2 days, send follow-up
Opened email 3x+          🔥 hot-opener          Very curious, checking back      Personal call within 24h
Clicked pricing           💰 pricing-click       Budget stage, evaluating cost    Send ROI calculator
Clicked case study        📊 validation-click    Proving ROI to themselves        Send 2 more case studies
Clicked next steps        🚀 action-click        Ready to move forward            Send POC proposal
Clicked calendar/SOW      ✅ commit-click        Buying signal, high intent       Call within 1 hour
Reopened 3+ days later    🔄 re-engaged          Back from the dead               "Saw you're back" email
No open after 7 days      💤 dormant             Not interested yet               Auto-nurture queue
Replied once, ghosted     👻 ghost               Lost interest or busy            Final "door's open" email

## Lead Temperature (Auto-Calculated)

### Temperature Rules

```
TAG               LOGIC                                              EMOJI
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🧊 cold           No opens, no clicks in 14+ days                    Freeze emoji
🌡️ warm           Opened 1-2x, maybe 1 click                         Thermometer
🔥 hot            3+ opens OR action-click (pricing, next steps)     Fire emoji
⚡ buying         Commit-click (calendar, SOW) OR replied positively  Lightning
❄️ stale          Was hot (🔥), now 14+ days silent                  Snowflake
```

### Temperature Actions

**🧊 Cold:**
- Action: Monthly check-in email with new case study
- Cadence: Low-touch, automated

**🌡️ Warm:**
- Action: Weekly value-add emails (whitepapers, industry news)
- Cadence: Medium-touch, semi-automated

**🔥 Hot:**
- Action: Daily follow-up, personal outreach, demo offer
- Cadence: High-touch, manual

**⚡ Buying:**
- Action: IMMEDIATE phone call, POC proposal, contract prep
- Cadence: Real-time alerts to sales rep

**❄️ Stale:**
- Action: "Checking in" + "Anything change?" re-engagement
- Cadence: One-time reactivation attempt

## Drip Triggers (Automated Sequences)

### Conditional Automation Rules

```

💤 dormant > 7 days              → Auto-send "Checking in" email            Day 7
👀 lurker detected               → Personal follow-up call from rep         Day 3
💰 pricing-click + no reply      → Send ROI calculator + case study         2 hours
👻 ghost > 14 days               → Final "Door's open" email                Day 14
⚡ buying signal                  → Slack alert to sales rep + email        Instant
📊 validation-click              → Send 2 more case studies (industry)      1 hour
🔥 hot-opener (3+ opens)         → "Noticed you're interested" email        Day 1
🔄 re-engaged (back after 30d)   → "Welcome back" + new feature update      Instant
🎯 serious-buyer                 → POC proposal + calendar link             30 min

## Drip Sequences (Full Templates)

### Sequence 1: The "Cold → Warm" Nurture

**Target:** 🧊 Cold leads (no opens in 14 days)

**Email 1 (Day 14):**
Subject: Still thinking about AI orchestration?

Hi [Name],

I reached out 2 weeks ago about BlackRoad OS. No worries if timing isn't right—just want to make sure you didn't miss it.

Quick recap: 30K-agent orchestration + HIPAA compliance + deterministic AI.

Worth a 5-minute look?

[Your Name]

**Email 2 (Day 21):**
Subject: [Case Study] How BioPharma Corp cut compliance costs 95%

Hi [Name],

Thought you'd find this useful: BioPharma Corp was spending $80K/year on HIPAA audits. BlackRoad OS cut that to $4K.

Full case study attached.

Even if you're not ready now, might be helpful for later.

[Your Name]

**Email 3 (Day 30 - Final):**
Subject: Closing your file (unless...)

Hi [Name],

I'll assume timing isn't right and close your file. No hard feelings!

If anything changes (regulatory pressure, scaling needs, new budget), I'm here.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Sequence 2: The "Lurker → Demo" Converter

**Target:** 👀 Lurkers (3+ opens, no clicks)

**Email 1 (Day 1 of lurker detection):**
Subject: Quick question about what you're looking for

Hi [Name],

I noticed you've checked out our emails a few times (no creepy tracking, just normal sales tech 😊).

Curious: What's the ONE thing you're trying to figure out about AI orchestration?

- Is it pricing?
- Technical fit?
- ROI proof?

Tell me and I'll send exactly what you need. No sales pitch.

[Your Name]

**Email 2 (Day 3):**
Subject: [Video] 90-second BlackRoad OS demo

Hi [Name],

Made you a quick Loom video: [link]

Shows exactly how BlackRoad OS orchestrates 30K agents with full compliance.

If it's useful, let's chat. If not, no worries.

[Your Name]

---

### Sequence 3: The "Pricing Click → Close" Accelerator

**Target:** 💰 Pricing clickers (but no reply)

**Email 1 (2 hours after pricing click):**
Subject: That pricing question you might have

Hi [Name],

Saw you checked out our pricing. Most people at this stage have one of two questions:

1. "Is this worth it?" → Here's the ROI: [attach calculator showing $540K/year savings]
2. "Can I afford it?" → Let's talk creative packaging (annual prepay, phased rollout, etc.)

Which question are you asking?

[Your Name]

**Email 2 (Day 2):**
Subject: [ROI Calculator] Your custom BlackRoad OS ROI

Hi [Name],

Plugged in some assumptions based on [Company size/industry]:

- Current compliance costs: $50K/month
- BlackRoad OS cost: $5K/month
- **Net savings: $540K/year**
- **ROI: 900%**

Want to refine these numbers on a quick call?

[Your Name]

**Email 3 (Day 5 - Assumptive Close):**
Subject: POC terms for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Prepared a 2-week POC proposal:
- Zero cost
- Success metrics: [fraud accuracy, compliance automation, agent scale]
- If you hit metrics, we move to contract

Attached. Ready to start [next Monday]?
