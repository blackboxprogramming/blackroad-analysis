After spending $200+/month on Railway, I built my own deployment platform.

Here's what I learned:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺:
• Railway/Heroku charge $5 base + $10/GB RAM
• Vendor lock-in makes migration painful
• Cloud-only means you don't own your infrastructure

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: BlackRoad Deploy
• $20/month flat rate - unlimited apps
• Self-hosted on your Raspberry Pis or VPSes
• Support for Node, Python, Go, Rust, Docker
• GitHub webhook auto-deployment
• Cloudflare DNS integration
• Zero vendor lock-in

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
• Python orchestrator
• Docker buildpacks
• Caddy reverse proxy
• Cloudflare API

𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗻:
Railway: $5 + $10/GB = $200+/month for production
BlackRoad: $20/month flat - save $2,160/year

Open source and ready to use.

**Body:**
```
Hi HN,

I built a self-hosted deployment platform after getting tired of $200+/month Railway bills.

BlackRoad Deploy lets you:
- Deploy Node/Python/Go/Rust/Docker apps
- Auto-deploy from GitHub webhooks
- Manage DNS via Cloudflare
- Run on your own infrastructure (Raspberry Pis, VPSes, etc.)

It's essentially Railway but self-hosted and $20/month flat instead of usage-based pricing.

Tech stack: Python orchestrator, Docker buildpacks, Caddy reverse proxy.

GitHub: https://github.com/blackboxprogramming/blackroad-deploy

Would love feedback from the HN community. First 10 users get 50% off.
